You are making online tutorials to teach software concepts, and would like a
way for you students to get the same experience as they would sitting down with
a teacher.  Open the file "example1.py" and annotate it with explanatory
comments for your students.

You are a student who is learning to program from online tutorials and have
downloaded the file "example2.jtr" as a suppliment to one of the tutorials.
Using this program, open the file and as it executes, describe what the program
is doing.

You have a previously existing file, which has been annotated for use in
teaching and you wish to change it to correct an error. Edit the program and
its annotations to correct your error. Then, generate a new trace file which
you can distribute to your students. Run the trace to verify its correctness.

You are a teacher who has received a trace file from one of your collegues.
When you run it, you notice a spelling error in an annotation.  Open the trace
in your favorite text editor and correct the error in the trace.
